	-- Project Majora --

Creator: Christopher Lif

Start Date: 2017/10/06

This small project is the first game that I will try to take to completion.
It is made using the Corona SDK and Lua scripting. All assets are created
with Piskel. The idea is based on the old game Majesty that was my 
childhood growing up and brought me into computer gaming.

Future Me, if you are reading this...good luck
